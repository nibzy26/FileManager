# Lomiri File Manager

Lomiri File Manager App is a convergent file manager supporting both mobile
devices and desktops. It is the official file manager app for Ubuntu Touch. We
follow an open source model where the code is available to anyone to branch and
hack on.
The Lomiri File Manager App originally followed a test driven development (TDD)
where tests were written in parallel to feature implementation to help spot
regressions easier.
